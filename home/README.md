### Udacity Data Engineering NanoDegree Project 4: Data Lakes

#### This project continues to follow the imaginary startup Sparkify as they scale their data infrastructure.
#### They have reached such a high volume of data and have requested to migrate it to a Data Lake on AWS.

#### This repository contains one python script named etl.py. It can be run from the command line preceeded by 'python'
#### like so: 'python etl.py'. The dl.cfg file contains the appropriate AWS credentials.

#### The script pulls all Sparkify data from S3, transforms it into efficient file formats and tables, then finally loads the data #back into S3. Spark as the best option to use due to thed data volume and speed requirement.
